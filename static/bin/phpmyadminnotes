PHPMyAdmin Installation complete. You can log in at: https://caa-markndennis.c9.io/phpmyadmin with the following username (and blank password):

       Username: markndennis

also note you cannot run phpmyadmin and django at the same time both require port 8080 therefore you have to stop one to start
the other.  It easy to stop django as there is a stop button provided on the console.  To stop apache (phpmyadmin) try
sudo service apache2 stop
